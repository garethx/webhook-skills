# Commerce Layer Webhooks

## When to Use This Skill

- How do I receive Commerce Layer webhooks?
- How do I verify Commerce Layer webhook signatures?
- How do I handle `orders.place`, `orders.approve`, or `orders.pay` events?
- Why is my Commerce Layer `X-CommerceLayer-Signature` verification failing?
- Setting up a Commerce Layer callback endpoint for order/shipment events

## Verification (core)

Commerce Layer signs the **raw** request body with **HMAC-SHA256** keyed on the
webhook's `shared_secret` and sends the digest as **base64** in the
`X-CommerceLayer-Signature` header. The triggering topic is in `X-CommerceLayer-Topic`.
The `shared_secret` is returned once, in the response when you create the webhook
(`POST /api/webhooks`) — it is **not** the same as your API credentials.

> **Read the raw body, NOT the parsed one.** Re-serializing parsed JSON changes bytes
> (key order, whitespace) and breaks the signature. Commerce Layer has no SDK verify
> helper, so verify manually (this matches the official docs example).

Node:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyCommerceLayerSignature(rawBody, signature, sharedSecret) {
  if (!signature) return false;
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', sharedSecret)
    .update(rawBody) // rawBody is a Buffer/string — never JSON.parse first
    .digest('base64');
  try {
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(signature), Buffer.from(expected));
  } catch {
    return false; // length mismatch = invalid
  }
}
```

Python:

```python
import hmac, hashlib, base64

def verify_commercelayer_signature(raw_body: bytes, signature: str, shared_secret: str) -> bool:
    if not signature:
        return False
    expected = base64.b64encode(
        hmac.new(shared_secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).digest()
    ).decode()
    return hmac.compare_digest(signature, expected)
```

## Common Event Types (Topics)

Topics use the format `{resource}.{trigger}`.

| Topic | Triggered When |
|-------|----------------|
| `orders.place` | Customer places an order |
| `orders.approve` | Order is approved |
| `orders.cancel` | Order is cancelled |
| `orders.pay` | Order is paid (payment captured) |
| `orders.refund` | Order is refunded |
| `customers.create` | A new customer is created |
| `shipments.ship` | A shipment is shipped |
| `shipments.deliver` | A shipment is delivered |

> Commerce Layer supports 100+ topics across `orders`, `customers`, `shipments`,
> `returns`, `refunds`, `authorizations`, `captures`, `gift_cards`, and more.
> For the full list, see [references/overview.md](references/overview.md) and the
> [Commerce Layer webhooks docs](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/real-time-webhooks).

**Payload:** JSON:API format, identical to fetching the resource via the REST API —
`{ "data": { "id", "type", "attributes", "relationships" } }`. For `.destroy` topics
only `data.id` is populated (other attributes are `null`).

## Environment Variables

```bash
COMMERCELAYER_SHARED_SECRET=your_webhook_shared_secret   # returned when you create the webhook
```

## Local Development

```bash
# Start tunnel (no account needed)
npx hookdeck-cli listen 3000 commercelayer --path /webhooks/commercelayer
```

## Reliability & Retries

- Your endpoint must return a **2xx** status within **5 seconds**.
- Failed deliveries are retried **up to 10 times**.
- After **5** unsuccessful attempts, the organization owner/admins are notified.
- After **30 consecutive failures** the webhook's circuit breaker trips
  (`circuit_state` → `closed`, `circuit_failure_count`) and it must be **reset manually**.

Verify fast, then do slow work asynchronously so you always answer within 5 seconds.
