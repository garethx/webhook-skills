# Ashby Webhooks Overview

## What Are Ashby Webhooks?

Ashby (an applicant tracking system / recruiting platform) uses webhooks to
notify your application when events happen in your hiring pipeline — a candidate
submits an application, moves to a new interview stage, gets hired, or an offer
is created. Instead of polling the Ashby API, Ashby sends an HTTP POST request to
your configured endpoint whenever a subscribed event occurs.

Webhooks are useful for syncing candidates to a data warehouse, triggering
onboarding when someone is hired, notifying Slack on stage changes, or driving
custom recruiting automation.

## The Payload Shape

Every Ashby webhook has the same top-level structure. The event name lives in the
body (`action`), **not** in a header:

```json
{
  "action": "applicationSubmit",
  "data": {
    // event-specific fields
  }
}
```

Dispatch on `payload.action` after verifying the signature.

## Common Event Types

Event names are **camelCase** with no dot notation (e.g. `interviewScheduleCreate`,
not `interviewSchedule.create`).

| Event (`action`) | Triggered When | Common Use Cases |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| `ping` | A webhook is created or edited (test event) | Verify endpoint connectivity |
| `applicationSubmit` | A candidate submits an application | Sync candidates, notify recruiters |
| `applicationUpdate` | An application changes (stage, status, fields) | Keep external systems in sync |
| `candidateHire` | A candidate is marked hired | Trigger onboarding, HRIS provisioning |
| `candidateStageChange` | A candidate moves to a new interview stage | Pipeline analytics, Slack alerts |
| `candidateDelete` | A candidate is deleted | Data cleanup, compliance |
| `candidateMerge` | Two candidate records are merged | Deduplicate downstream records |
| `interviewScheduleCreate` | An interview schedule is created | Calendar sync, interviewer prep |
| `interviewScheduleUpdate` | An interview schedule is updated | Reschedule automation |
| `offerCreate` | An offer is created | Offer tracking, approvals |
| `offerUpdate` | An offer is updated | Keep offer state in sync |
| `jobPostingUpdate` | A job posting changes | Sync careers site |
| `jobPostingPublish` | A job posting is published | Publish to job boards |
| `pushToHRIS` | Data is pushed to an HRIS | HRIS integration |

## Fan-Out Events

Some events trigger additional events. For example, `candidateHire` also fires
`applicationUpdate` and `candidateStageChange`. Because you may receive several
related webhooks for one logical action — and Ashby retries failed deliveries —
**make handlers idempotent** (e.g. dedupe on a stable ID from `data`).

## Event Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Ashby-Signature` | HMAC SHA-256 signature of the raw body, as `sha256=<hex>` |
| `Ashby-Webhook` (User-Agent) | Identifies Ashby requests — **not** a security control |

## Ping and Auto-Disable

When you create or edit a webhook, Ashby sends a `ping` event. If your endpoint
does not respond, or returns a status code `>= 400`, Ashby **disables** the
webhook. Re-enable it in the dashboard after fixing your endpoint. Always return
`2xx` quickly once the signature is verified.
