# MailerSend Webhooks - Express Example

Receives MailerSend webhooks at `POST /webhooks/mailersend` and verifies the
`Signature` header: lowercase hex HMAC-SHA256 of the **raw request body**, keyed
with the webhook's signing secret.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A MailerSend account with a verified sending domain
- The webhook's **signing secret** (Email → Domains → Manage → Webhooks → your
  webhook). This is not your API token.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Add your MailerSend webhook signing secret to `.env` as
   `MAILERSEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

Server runs on http://localhost:3000

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

The tests generate real signatures with MailerSend's exact algorithm —
`hex(HMAC_SHA256(signing_secret, raw_body))`, no timestamp, no prefix — and
cover the traps that break real integrations:

- a re-serialised body is rejected, even though it's semantically identical
- a malformed/short `Signature` returns 401 instead of throwing `RangeError`
  from `crypto.timingSafeEqual`
- the `webhook.test` ping verifies against the **fixed public test secret**
- a *real* event signed with that public test secret is **rejected**

## Receive real webhooks locally

```bash
npx hookdeck-cli listen 3000 mailersend --path /webhooks/mailersend
```

No account required — the CLI creates a guest account on first run and gives you
a web UI for inspecting requests. Paste the printed URL into the webhook's URL
field in MailerSend.

MailerSend fires its `webhook.test` ping the moment you click Save, so you'll see
a request immediately. If your endpoint doesn't return 2xx to that ping, **the
webhook is not saved at all**.

## Send a test event

From the MailerSend dashboard, open the webhook, and under **Events** click
**Test webhook**, then pick an event from the dropdown.

Or replay the URL-validation ping yourself:

```bash
BODY='{"type":"webhook.test","message":"This is a ping test message","created_at":"2026-03-27T07:24:20.577080Z"}'
SIG=$(printf '%s' "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac 'test_Am3L1GuOIc4blLUuHqAPxxwkZaJyEk8G' -hex | sed 's/^.* //')

curl -i http://localhost:3000/webhooks/mailersend \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Signature: $SIG" \
  -d "$BODY"
```

## Notes

- The route uses `express.raw({ type: '*/*' })`. The signature covers the exact
  bytes received — parsing and re-serialising the JSON breaks verification. Never
  register a global `express.json()` in front of this route.
- **`webhook.test` is signed with `test_Am3L1GuOIc4blLUuHqAPxxwkZaJyEk8G`**, a
  fixed secret published in MailerSend's docs. The handler accepts it so the
  webhook can save, but rejects any *non*-ping event signed with it — because a
  public secret means anyone can forge that signature.
- **Respond within 3 seconds.** The handler replies 200 before doing any work.
  MailerSend logs a slower response as a failed attempt.
- **4xx other than 429 is never retried**, so the 401 on a bad signature gets
  exactly one attempt. That's intended — but it means a broken verifier silently
  drops every event.
- **No delivery id, timestamp or nonce is sent**, so transport-level replay
  protection is impossible. The example dedupes on `data.id`; use Redis or your
  database in production rather than the in-memory `Set`.
- `data.meta` is an empty **array** `[]` when there's nothing to report, and an
  object otherwise. `normalizeMeta()` handles it.
- `created_at` arrives in two formats — ISO-8601 with microseconds and `Z`, and
  space-separated with no timezone (`sender_identity.verified`, `maintenance.*`).
  `parseCreatedAt()` handles both.
- MailerSend documents **no source-IP allowlist and no `X-MailerSend-*` headers**.
  Don't build either into your receiver.
