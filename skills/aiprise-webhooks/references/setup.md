# Setting Up AiPrise Webhooks

## Prerequisites

- An AiPrise account with access to the Dashboard
- Your AiPrise **API private key** (this is also your webhook signing key)
- Your application's callback endpoint URL (publicly reachable, HTTPS)

## Get Your Signing Key

AiPrise webhooks are **not** signed with a separate webhook/endpoint secret. The
HMAC key is your **AiPrise API private key** directly (for example
`abcdef12-pqrs-abcd-pqrs-abcde0123456`).

1. Go to the AiPrise Dashboard.
2. Open your API settings and copy the API private key.
3. Store it as `AIPRISE_API_KEY` in your environment — your handler uses the same
   value both to call the AiPrise API and to verify callback signatures.

> Keep the API private key secret. Anyone with it can forge valid callback signatures.

## Configure Callback URLs

Callback URLs can be set at the template level or overridden per request.

### Template level (applies to every session using the template)

1. Go to Dashboard → **View Templates** → select your template `{TemplateID}`.
2. Set:
   - **Callback URL** — receives verification result callbacks.
   - **Events Callback URL** — receives business-profile change events.
3. Save the template.

### Per request (overrides the template for a single session)

When creating a verification session via the API, pass:

- `callback_url` — verification result callback destination.
- `events_callback_url` — business-profile change events destination.

Request-level URLs take precedence over the template configuration.

## Recommended Endpoint Path

Match your handler route to the examples in this skill:

```
POST /webhooks/aiprise
```

## Correlate Sessions with Your Records

Pass `client_reference_id` when starting a verification session (e.g. your user ID
or order ID). AiPrise echoes it back in the callback alongside
`verification_session_id`, so you can match the outcome to the right record.

## Test Mode vs Live Mode

Use AiPrise's sandbox/test environment and templates to trigger sample verification
outcomes before going live. Run a test verification and confirm your endpoint:

1. Receives a POST at `/webhooks/aiprise`.
2. Passes `X-HMAC-SIGNATURE` verification (see [verification.md](verification.md)).
3. Dispatches correctly on `aiprise_summary.verification_result`.

## Local Development

Use the Hookdeck CLI to receive callbacks on your machine — no account required:

```bash
npx hookdeck-cli listen 3000 aiprise --path /webhooks/aiprise
```

Set the Hookdeck-provided URL as your template's callback URL (or per-request
`callback_url`) while developing.
