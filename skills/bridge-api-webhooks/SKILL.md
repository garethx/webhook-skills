  Receive and verify Bridge API webhooks (bridgeapi.io — the open-banking

  handling events like item.created, item.refreshed, item.account.updated,
  payment.transaction.created, or user.deleted.

# Bridge API Webhooks

> **Which Bridge?** This skill is for **Bridge API** (`bridgeapi.io`), the
> open-banking / account-aggregation platform by Bridge (formerly Bankin').
> It is **not** [bridge.xyz](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/tree/main/skills/bridge-xyz-webhooks)
> (the stablecoin/crypto payments company). See
> [bridge-xyz-webhooks](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/tree/main/skills/bridge-xyz-webhooks)
> for that one.

## When to Use This Skill

- How do I receive Bridge API webhooks?
- How do I verify the `BridgeApi-Signature` header?
- Why is my Bridge API webhook signature verification failing?
- How do I handle `item.refreshed`, `item.account.updated`, or `payment.transaction.created` events?
- How do I support Bridge's signing-secret rotation (two active secrets)?

## Verification (core)

Bridge signs the **raw** request body with HMAC-SHA256, keyed on the webhook's
signing secret, and sends the digest in the `BridgeApi-Signature` header as one
or more scheme-prefixed, comma-separated values — **hex, uppercase**:

```
BridgeApi-Signature: v1=E5637CDB...,v1=A1B2C3D4...
```

Only the `v1` scheme is valid — ignore any other scheme to avoid downgrade
attacks. Multiple `v1` values can appear during a secret rotation (the old
secret stays valid for 24h, up to 2 active signatures), so accept the webhook if
**any** `v1` value matches. Compare timing-safe over the raw body.

Node:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyBridgeWebhook(rawBody, signatureHeader, secret) {
  if (!signatureHeader) return false;
  const expected = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex');
  // Keep only v1= signatures (ignore other schemes → no downgrade), strip the prefix
  const signatures = signatureHeader.split(',')
    .map((s) => s.trim())
    .filter((s) => s.startsWith('v1='))
    .map((s) => s.slice(3));
  if (signatures.length === 0) return false;
  // hex decode is case-insensitive, so Bridge's UPPERCASE hex compares cleanly
  return signatures.some((sig) => {
    try {
      return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(sig, 'hex'), Buffer.from(expected, 'hex'));
    } catch {
      return false; // malformed / length mismatch
    }
  });
}
```

Python:

```python
import hmac, hashlib

def verify_bridge_webhook(raw_body: bytes, signature_header: str, secret: str) -> bool:
    if not signature_header:
        return False
    expected = hmac.new(secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    signatures = [s.strip()[3:] for s in signature_header.split(",") if s.strip().startswith("v1=")]
    # hex compare is case-insensitive → lowercase both sides before compare_digest
    return any(hmac.compare_digest(sig.lower(), expected.lower()) for sig in signatures)
```

## Common Event Types

The event name is the `type` field in the JSON body (there is no event header).
Names are lowercase `resource.action` (except the dashboard test event).

| Event | Triggered When |
|-------|----------------|
| `item.created` | A bank connection (item) is created |
| `item.refreshed` | An item's data finished refreshing |
| `item.account.created` | A new account is discovered under an item |
| `item.account.updated` | An account's balance/details changed |
| `item.account.deleted` | An account is removed from an item |
| `payment.transaction.created` | A payment transaction is created |
| `payment.transaction.updated` | A payment transaction's status changed |
| `payment.link.updated` | A payment link's status changed |
| `user.deleted` | A user is deleted |
| `TEST_EVENT` | Sent by the dashboard's "Send a test" button |

> **For the full event reference**, see [Bridge API Webhooks docs](https://docs.bridgeapi.io/docs/webhooks).

## Payload Structure

```json
{
  "type": "item.refreshed",
  "timestamp": 1699999999,
  "content": {
    "item_id": 12345,
    "user_uuid": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "status": 0
  }
}
```

`content` fields vary by event. **Expect webhooks for already-deleted users or
items** — handle them defensively (a lookup miss is normal, not an error).

## Important Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `BridgeApi-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signatures, `v1=<UPPERCASE_HEX>` (comma-separated for rotation) |

## Environment Variables

```bash
BRIDGE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_signing_secret   # Shown once when the webhook is created/rotated
```

## Source IPs

Bridge delivers from fixed IPs — optionally allowlist them (read the client IP
from `X-Forwarded-For` if you sit behind a proxy/load balancer):

```
63.32.31.5
52.215.247.62
34.249.92.209
```

Keep your response body under **10 KB** and reply with `200` as quickly as
possible. Non-200 or slow responses are retried with exponential backoff for 1–2 days.

## Local Development

```bash
# Start tunnel (no account needed)
npx hookdeck-cli listen 3000 bridge-api --path /webhooks/bridge-api
```

## Recommended: webhook-handler-patterns

We recommend installing the [webhook-handler-patterns](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/tree/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns) skill alongside this one for handler sequence, idempotency, error handling, and retry logic. Key references (open on GitHub):

- [Handler sequence](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/handler-sequence.md) — Verify first, parse second, handle idempotently third
- [Idempotency](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/idempotency.md) — Prevent duplicate processing
- [Error handling](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/error-handling.md) — Return codes, logging, dead letter queues
- [Retry logic](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/retry-logic.md) — Provider retry schedules, backoff patterns
