# Paymob Webhooks - FastAPI Example

Minimal example of receiving Paymob **Transaction Processed Callbacks** with
HMAC-SHA512 signature verification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A Paymob account with an HMAC secret (Dashboard → Settings → Account Info → HMAC)

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Add your Paymob HMAC secret to `.env`:
   ```bash
   PAYMOB_HMAC_SECRET=your_hmac_secret_here
   ```

## Run

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The webhook endpoint is `POST /webhooks/paymob`.

## How Verification Works

Paymob does **not** ship a Python SDK with webhook verification, so this example
verifies manually. Paymob does **not** sign the raw body — it computes
HMAC-SHA512 (hex) over a fixed, ordered concatenation of 20 transaction fields
and sends the result as the **`hmac` query parameter** (`?hmac=<hex>`). The
handler reads it from `request.query_params`, parses the JSON, rebuilds the
string, and compares it with `hmac.compare_digest`. Note Python's
`str(True)` is `"True"`, so booleans are converted to lowercase explicitly. See
[../../references/verification.md](../../references/verification.md) for the full
field list and gotchas.

## Test

```bash
pytest test_webhook.py -v
```

The tests generate real signatures with the same HMAC-SHA512 algorithm Paymob
uses and assert valid, invalid, missing, and tampered signatures are handled
correctly.

## Receive Real Webhooks Locally

Use the Hookdeck CLI to tunnel Paymob callbacks to your local server (no account
required):

```bash
npx hookdeck-cli listen 8000 paymob --path /webhooks/paymob
```

Set the printed URL as your callback URL in the Paymob dashboard.
