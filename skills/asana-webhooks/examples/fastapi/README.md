# Asana Webhooks - FastAPI Example

Minimal example of receiving Asana webhooks with the `X-Hook-Secret` handshake and
`X-Hook-Signature` verification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- An Asana Personal Access Token (to create the webhook)
- A project (or other resource) `gid` to watch

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Capture `ASANA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from the handshake (see below) and add it to `.env`.

## Run

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Server runs on http://localhost:8000

## Receive Webhooks Locally

```bash
npx hookdeck-cli listen 8000 asana --path /webhooks/asana
```

Copy the public URL it prints, then create the webhook (this triggers the handshake):

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": {"resource": "<PROJECT_GID>", "target": "https://<your-tunnel>/webhooks/asana"}}'
```

The handler echoes `X-Hook-Secret` during the handshake and logs it. Put that value in
`ASANA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (and restart) so subsequent event deliveries verify.

## How It Works

- **Handshake:** a request with an `X-Hook-Secret` header is echoed back with `200`.
- **Delivery:** a request with an `X-Hook-Signature` header is verified with
  HMAC-SHA256 over the raw body (`await request.body()`), then the `events` batch is
  dispatched.
- **Heartbeats:** `{"events": []}` deliveries are verified and acknowledged.

The [`asana` SDK](https://pypi.org/project/asana/) is included for creating webhooks
and fetching full resource details after an event (events are compact — they reference
a `gid`, not the full object).

## Test

```bash
pytest test_webhook.py -v
```

## Endpoints

- `POST /webhooks/asana` - Handles the handshake and verifies/dispatches events
- `GET /health` - Health check
