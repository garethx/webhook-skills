# Nuvemshop (Tiendanube) Webhooks

## When to Use This Skill

- How do I receive Nuvemshop / Tiendanube webhooks?
- How do I verify Nuvemshop webhook signatures?
- How do I handle `order/created`, `order/paid`, or `order/cancelled` events?
- Why is my `x-linkedstore-hmac-sha256` verification failing?
- Setting up a webhook receiver for a Nuvemshop app

## Verification (core)

Nuvemshop signs the **raw request body** with **HMAC-SHA256** keyed on your
**app's client secret** (the OAuth app secret from the Partners Portal) and sends
the digest **hex-encoded** in the `x-linkedstore-hmac-sha256` header. Compute the
HMAC on the exact raw bytes **before** JSON parsing and compare timing-safe.

There is **no official SDK** — verification is manual in every language.

Node:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyNuvemshopWebhook(rawBody, hmacHeader, clientSecret) {
  if (!hmacHeader) return false;
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', clientSecret)
    .update(rawBody)          // rawBody is a Buffer/string of the exact bytes
    .digest('hex');
  try {
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(hmacHeader), Buffer.from(expected));
  } catch {
    return false;             // length mismatch = invalid
  }
}
```

Python:

```python
import hmac, hashlib

def verify_nuvemshop_webhook(raw_body: bytes, hmac_header: str, client_secret: str) -> bool:
    if not hmac_header:
        return False
    expected = hmac.new(client_secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(hmac_header, expected)
```

> **Important**: Respond with a `2XX` status within **3 seconds**. Nuvemshop
> retries on timeout/non-2XX (immediately, then ~5/10/15 min, then exponential
> backoff ×1.4, up to 18 attempts over 48h). Do slow work asynchronously.

## Thin Payloads — Fetch the Full Resource

Nuvemshop payloads are intentionally minimal. A typical body is:

```json
{ "store_id": 123456, "event": "order/created", "id": 999888 }
```

Only `store_id`, `event`, and (for resource events) a resource `id` are sent. To
get the full record, call the REST API scoped to that store, e.g.
`GET https://api.tiendanube.com/v1/{store_id}/orders/{id}` with the store's
access token.

## Common Event Types

Events use `resource/action` format.

| Event | Triggered When |
|-------|----------------|
| `order/created` | New order placed |
| `order/paid` | Order payment received |
| `order/cancelled` | Order cancelled |
| `order/updated` | Order modified |
| `order/fulfilled` | Order fulfilled/shipped |
| `product/created` | New product added |
| `product/updated` | Product modified |
| `product/deleted` | Product removed |
| `customer/created` | New customer registered |
| `app/uninstalled` | App uninstalled from the store |

## Environment Variables

```bash
NUVEMSHOP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_app_client_secret   # OAuth app "Client secret" from the Partners Portal
```

## Local Development

```bash
# Start tunnel (no account needed)
npx hookdeck-cli listen 3000 nuvemshop --path /webhooks/nuvemshop
```

## Recommended: webhook-handler-patterns

We recommend installing the [webhook-handler-patterns](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/tree/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns) skill alongside this one for handler sequence, idempotency, error handling, and retry logic. Key references (open on GitHub):

- [Handler sequence](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/handler-sequence.md) — Verify first, parse second, handle idempotently third
- [Idempotency](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/idempotency.md) — Prevent duplicate processing (Nuvemshop retries up to 18 times)
- [Error handling](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/error-handling.md) — Return codes, logging, dead letter queues
- [Retry logic](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/retry-logic.md) — Provider retry schedules, backoff patterns
