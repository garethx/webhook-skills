# How to Verify Nuvemshop (Tiendanube) Webhook Signatures

## How It Works

Nuvemshop signs every webhook request so you can confirm it genuinely came from
Nuvemshop and was not tampered with.

- **Algorithm:** HMAC-SHA256
- **Key:** your app's **client secret** (the OAuth app secret)
- **Signed content:** the **raw request body** (exact bytes, before any JSON parsing)
- **Encoding:** lowercase **hex**
- **Header:** `x-linkedstore-hmac-sha256`

This is a custom single-header scheme — **not** the Standard Webhooks spec.
There is no `webhook-id` / `webhook-timestamp` / `webhook-signature`, and there
is **no timestamp** in the signed content.

There is **no official SDK** (community libraries only), so verification is
implemented manually in every language.

## Implementation

### Node.js (Express, Next.js)

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyNuvemshopWebhook(rawBody, hmacHeader, clientSecret) {
  if (!hmacHeader) return false;
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', clientSecret)
    .update(rawBody)            // rawBody must be the exact bytes received
    .digest('hex');
  try {
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(hmacHeader), Buffer.from(expected));
  } catch {
    return false;               // different lengths => invalid
  }
}
```

### Python (FastAPI)

```python
import hmac, hashlib

def verify_nuvemshop_webhook(raw_body: bytes, hmac_header: str, client_secret: str) -> bool:
    if not hmac_header:
        return False
    expected = hmac.new(client_secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(hmac_header, expected)
```

## Common Gotchas

- **Use the raw body.** Verify against the exact bytes received. If your
  framework parses JSON first and you re-serialize it, whitespace/key-order
  differences will change the hash and verification will fail. In Express use
  `express.raw()`; in Next.js use `await request.text()`; in FastAPI use
  `await request.body()`.
- **The key is the client secret**, not an access token and not a separate
  "webhook secret". It's the same secret used for OAuth token exchange.
- **Hex, not base64.** The digest is hex-encoded (unlike Shopify, which uses
  base64). Don't base64-decode the header.
- **No timestamp.** There's nothing to check for replay tolerance in the
  signature itself. If you need replay protection, dedupe on the payload's
  `store_id` + `event` + `id`.
- **Constant-time compare.** Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual` /
  `hmac.compare_digest`, and guard against buffer length mismatches (they throw
  in Node).
- **Header casing.** HTTP headers are case-insensitive; most frameworks
  lowercase them, so read `x-linkedstore-hmac-sha256`.

## Debugging Verification Failures

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Always invalid | Verifying the parsed/re-serialized body instead of the raw body |
| Always invalid | Using an access token or wrong secret instead of the app **client secret** |
| Always invalid | Base64-decoding the header (it's hex) |
| `timingSafeEqual` throws | Comparing buffers of different lengths — wrap in try/catch and return false |
| Works locally, fails behind proxy | A proxy/body parser mutated the payload before your handler saw it |

## Respond Quickly

Nuvemshop waits only **3 seconds** for a `2XX`. Verify, enqueue any heavy work,
and return `200` immediately. Non-2XX or timeouts trigger retries (up to 18
attempts over 48h), so make handlers idempotent.
