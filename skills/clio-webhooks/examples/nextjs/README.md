# Clio Webhooks - Next.js Example

Minimal example of receiving Clio webhooks with the `X-Hook-Secret` activation
handshake and `X-Hook-Signature` (HMAC-SHA256) verification using the
Next.js App Router.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Clio webhook created via `POST /api/v4/webhooks.json` (see the skill's
  `references/setup.md`)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

3. Add your Clio shared secret to `.env.local` as `CLIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Clio
   delivers this secret in the `X-Hook-Secret` header during the activation
   handshake — store it after confirming the handshake.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server runs on http://localhost:3000

## Test

Run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Using Hookdeck CLI

Forward webhooks to your local server (no account required):

```bash
npx hookdeck-cli listen 3000 clio --path /webhooks/clio
```

## How It Works

- **Handshake** — A POST carrying an `X-Hook-Secret` header is Clio's activation
  request. The route echoes the header back with `200 OK`; the webhook is not
  enabled until this succeeds.
- **Events** — Signed POSTs carry `X-Hook-Signature`, the HMAC-SHA256 digest
  of the raw body (read via `await request.text()`). The route verifies it
  before processing.

## Endpoint

- `POST /webhooks/clio` - Handles the handshake and verifies + processes events
