# Clio Signature Verification

## How It Works

Clio proves that event deliveries are authentic by signing each one:

1. During the **handshake**, Clio gives your endpoint a shared secret via the
   `X-Hook-Secret` header (see [setup.md](setup.md)). You store it.
2. For every **event** delivery, Clio computes
   `HMAC-SHA256(shared_secret, raw_request_body)` and sends the digest in the
   `X-Hook-Signature` header.
3. Your endpoint recomputes the same HMAC over the **raw** request body and
   compares it to `X-Hook-Signature` using a constant-time comparison.

There is no timestamp and no `sha256=` prefix — `X-Hook-Signature` is just the
digest.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Algorithm | HMAC-SHA256 |
| Encoding | **Not specified in Clio's docs** — accept hex or base64 (see below) |
| Header | `X-Hook-Signature` |
| Signed content | Raw request body (exact bytes) |
| Key | Shared secret from the `X-Hook-Secret` handshake |
| SDK | None — Clio has no official server SDK; verify manually |

### Encoding: hex or base64

Clio's Webhook Security page says only that Clio "will compute an HMAC-SHA256
signature based on the shared secret and the request body" and place it in
`X-Hook-Signature`. It does **not** state whether that digest is hex- or
base64-encoded, and neither does the rest of the API reference.

Rather than guess, compute the digest once and **constant-time compare against
both encodings** — the correct one matches, the other never will. Then
**confirm which encoding your real deliveries actually use** (log the raw header
value from one live delivery: 64 lowercase hex characters vs a 44-character
base64 string ending in `=`) and you can safely narrow the check to that one.

## Implementation

Clio publishes no server SDK, so verification is manual in every language. Always
use the **raw** body — parsing then re-serializing JSON changes bytes (whitespace,
key order) and breaks the HMAC.

### Node.js

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyClioWebhook(rawBody, signatureHeader, secret) {
  if (!signatureHeader) return false;
  const digest = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest();
  // Encoding is unspecified in Clio's docs — accept hex or base64.
  return [digest.toString('hex'), digest.toString('base64')].some((expected) => {
    try {
      return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(signatureHeader), Buffer.from(expected));
    } catch {
      return false; // length mismatch → not a match
    }
  });
}
```

> Do **not** write `Buffer.from(signatureHeader, 'hex')`. If Clio sends base64,
> that silently decodes the wrong bytes instead of failing loudly, and the
> comparison quietly never matches.

### Python

```python
import hmac, hashlib, base64

def verify_clio_webhook(raw_body: bytes, signature_header: str, secret: str) -> bool:
    if not signature_header:
        return False
    digest = hmac.new(secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).digest()
    # Encoding is unspecified in Clio's docs — accept hex or base64.
    return (
        hmac.compare_digest(signature_header, digest.hex())
        or hmac.compare_digest(signature_header, base64.b64encode(digest).decode())
    )
```

## The Handshake Comes First

Do not run signature verification on the activation request. A POST that carries
an `X-Hook-Secret` header is the handshake — respond `200 OK` and echo the header
back. Only requests **without** `X-Hook-Secret` (i.e. carrying
`X-Hook-Signature`) are signed events to verify.

```javascript
const hookSecret = req.headers['x-hook-secret'];
if (hookSecret) {
  res.set('X-Hook-Secret', hookSecret); // confirm activation
  return res.status(200).end();
}
// otherwise: verify X-Hook-Signature ...
```

## Common Gotchas

- **Use the raw body.** Verify the exact received bytes. In Express use
  `express.raw()`; in Next.js use `await request.text()`; in FastAPI use
  `await request.body()`. Never `JSON.stringify(parsedBody)`.
- **Do not assume an encoding.** Clio's docs never say hex or base64, so accept
  both and confirm against a live delivery. There is no `sha256=` prefix.
- **Handshake before verification.** Verifying the `X-Hook-Secret` handshake POST
  will fail (it has no `X-Hook-Signature`); handle it separately.
- **Use the right secret.** Verify with the secret Clio delivered during the
  handshake for that specific webhook — not the OAuth client secret. With
  multiple webhooks, key the stored secret by `meta.webhook_id`.
- **Constant-time compare.** Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual` /
  `hmac.compare_digest`, never `===`.
- **Header case.** HTTP headers are case-insensitive; frameworks usually expose
  them lowercased (`x-hook-signature`).

## Debugging Verification Failures

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Every event fails verification | Body was parsed/re-serialized before hashing — use the raw body |
| Works locally, fails in prod | A proxy/body-parser is mutating the body upstream |
| Handshake "fails" | You verified the `X-Hook-Secret` POST instead of echoing it back |
| Signature never matches | Wrong secret (used OAuth client secret, or a different webhook's secret) |
| Signature never matches, secret is right | You hardcoded one encoding — log the header and compare against both hex and base64 |
| `timingSafeEqual` throws | Comparing buffers of different lengths — wrap in try/catch and return false |
