# Green Dot Webhooks Overview

## What Are Green Dot Webhooks?

Green Dot's Embedded Finance platform (Banking-as-a-Service, BaaS) sends
**webhooks** to a partner-hosted HTTPS endpoint whenever something happens on an
account, card, or transfer in your program. Green Dot POSTs a JSON body to the
callback URL your Green Dot representative registers for you.

Unlike most providers, Green Dot uses **push authentication**: Green Dot
authenticates *itself* to your endpoint (see below), rather than you verifying a
single HMAC signature over the body. This is the same class of security model as
Auth0 Custom Log Streams — the trust is established by the credentials on the
incoming request, not solely by a body signature.

## How Deliveries Are Authenticated

The primary mechanism is an **OAuth 2.0 client_credentials Bearer token** sent
on the `Authorization` header of every webhook request. The token carries the
scope `post:webhook`. Green Dot supports several per-partner variants configured
by your rep:

- **OAuth** — client_credentials grant (the default)
- **FormOAuth** / **FormUrlEncodedOAuth** — form-encoded token requests
- **PartnerOAuth** — token issued by the partner's own authorization server
- **Certificate** — mutual TLS (mTLS) / PKCS#7 client certificates

A delivery may also carry an **`x-gd-signature`** header, but its algorithm,
encoding, and canonical payload are **not documented publicly**, and sample
payloads show no signature header. This skill therefore does **not** verify it —
a guessed HMAC would give false confidence. If you need payload-level
verification, obtain the specification (and signing key) from your Green Dot
representative first.

See [verification.md](verification.md) for details.

## Request Headers You Will Receive

| Header | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | OAuth client_credentials token, scope `post:webhook` |
| `x-GD-RequestId` | Correlation id — **you must echo this back** in your response |
| `x-gd-signature` | May be present; algorithm undocumented — not verified by this skill |
| `User-Agent: greendot-baas/3.0.0` | Identifies Green Dot's delivery agent |
| `Content-Type: application/json` | JSON body |

## Common Event Types

The event name is the **`eventType`** field inside the JSON body.

| `eventType` | Triggered When | Common Use Cases |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| `transaction` | A card or account transaction posts | Ledger sync, spend notifications |
| `accountUpdated` | Account details or status change | Keep local account records in sync |
| `achTransfer` | An ACH transfer changes state | Funding / payout status tracking |
| `cardUpdate` | A card is issued, activated, or changes status | Card lifecycle, reissue flows |
| `billPayTransfer` | A bill pay transfer changes state | Bill pay status, receipts |
| `directDepositSwitch` | A direct-deposit switch progresses | DD onboarding funnel |
| `provisioning` | Account / card provisioning progresses | Onboarding orchestration |

Green Dot also emits statement-ready, interest-paid, NSF/failed-transfer, NOC,
eWallet, paper-check, mail-tracking, promotional, P2P, ATM PIN, auto money
movement, and adjustment final-status events. **The exact set enabled for your
program is configured per-partner** — confirm the `eventType` values you will
receive with your Green Dot rep.

## Event Payload Structure

Payloads are JSON objects keyed by `eventType`. A representative shape:

```json
{
  "eventType": "transaction",
  "programCode": "MYPROGRAM",
  "eventId": "1c1b0b2a-2f3e-4a5b-9c8d-0e1f2a3b4c5d",
  "eventTimestamp": "2026-01-15T12:34:56Z",
  "data": {
    "accountId": "acct_123",
    "amount": 42.50,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "posted"
  }
}
```

Field names inside `data` vary by `eventType`. Treat unknown fields defensively.

## Acknowledging a Delivery

Your endpoint must respond `200` or `201` and:

1. **Echo the `x-GD-RequestId` header** back on the response.
2. Return a JSON body with a `responseDetails` array:

```json
{ "responseDetails": [{ "code": 0, "subCode": 0, "description": "<x-GD-RequestId>" }] }
```

`code: 0` signals success. Anything else (or a non-2xx status / timeout) causes
Green Dot to retry the delivery if retries are enabled for your program.
